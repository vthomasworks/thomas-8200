just another repository
This is extremely strange and I do not know, nor do I understand why I am doing this. It took me some time to determine the right thing to do and boy did it take me a while. I am really just testing ut how quickly I type. I am also just writing what I want because the instructions are for me to write down something about myself. I do not want to write anything about me. I don't knw why I am still writing this down. This is weird and great at the same time. OK I will finish writing this weird note to myself.
